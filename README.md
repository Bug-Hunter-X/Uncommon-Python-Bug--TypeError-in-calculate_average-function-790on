This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a common, yet often overlooked error: the `TypeError` that arises when attempting to calculate the average of a list containing non-numeric values. The `bug.py` file shows the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.py` file presents a corrected version which includes robust error handling, preventing the `TypeError` and providing informative feedback to the user.  The example highlights the importance of input validation when developing functions that operate on user-provided data.
